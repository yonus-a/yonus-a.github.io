	  <h1>hwo to fix zoom out problem in mobile browsers</h1>
	  <p>
		  And if you were to view this on the ipad the footer is displaying 100% width, but the entire page is now displaying as though its zoomed waaaaay out and its adding tons of white space to the right left of the page and under the footer as well. I take it that the website is adjusting itself as though it is being viewed on an iphone. But im not sure why it's adjusting like that? I would think that the content="device-width" would set the width to that of the device its being viewed on? Or have i misunderstood this completely.
